## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I am a postdoctoral fellow working at Nanyang Technological University.

My main interests are algebraic combinatorics, particularly association schemes.

At the moment, I am working with Dr. Gary Greaves on optimal configurations in finite geometry.

I am open to research collaborations, conferences, workshops, and most mathematical endeavors.

You can learn more about me at my website dombriones.github.io
